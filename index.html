    </h1>

    <h2>Ability Scores</h2>
    <p>
        PCs have three abilities: <b>Strength (STR)</b>, <b>Dexterity (DEX)</b>, and <b>Intelligence (INT)</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Saves</h2>
    <p>
        If a character attempts something where the outcome is uncertain and failure has consequences, they need to make
        a save.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make a save, <b>roll a d20 and add the most relevant ability's score</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the <b>total is at least 10</b>, the character succeeds. If not, they fail.
    </p>

    <h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
    <p>
        If there are factors or abilities that make the save significantly easier or harder, the roll has either
        advantage or disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a roll has advantage, roll 2d20 and use the better of the two dice.
    </p>
    <p>
        If it has disadvantage, roll 2d20 and use the worse of the two dice.
    </p>

    <h2>Stress</h2>
    <p>
        Once per save, you may re-roll d20 and take 1 stress.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every 1 stress above your intelligence, you get -1 to all saves.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every full day of rest in safety, halve and round down your stress.
    </p>

    <h2>Hit Points</h2>
    <p>
        Hit points protect you from lethal damage. Subtract hit points when you take damage.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don’t have enough hit points, subtract the leftover damage from your strength. You die on 0 or less
        strength.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every full day of rest in safety, double your hit points (minimum of 1).
    </p>
    <p>
        For every full week of rest in safety, recover 1 strength.
    </p>

    <h2>Exhaustion</h2>
    <p>
        Characters get 1 level of exhaustion:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>-</b> For each consecutive day without enough sleep (8 hours)
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>-</b> For each consecutive day without enough clean water
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>-</b> For each day without enough food
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>-</b> For a week of travel without a full day of rest
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>Inventory</h2>
    <p>
        PCs have a number of item slots equal to 10.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most items take up 1 slot, but particularly heavy or bulky items may take up more slots.
    </p>
    <p>
        Groups of small, identical items may be bundled into the same slot.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a general guideline, a slot holds around 5 pounds of weight. A slot can hold 100 coins.
    </p>

    <h2>Time</h2>
    <p>
        One <b>round</b> is <b>10 seconds</b>. This is usually the unit of time-tracking during combat.
    </p>
    <p>
        One <b>minute</b> is <b>6 rounds</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One <b>turn</b> is <b>10 minutes</b>. This is usually the unit of time-tracking when dungeon delving.
    </p>
    <p>
        One <b>hour</b> is <b>6 turns</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One <b>watch</b> is <b>4 hours</b>. This is usually the unit of time-tracking when travelling overland.
    </p>
    <p>
        One <b>day</b> is divided into <b>6 watches</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Travel Pace</h2>
    <p>
        In ideal conditions, you can cover <b>3 miles per hour</b> while travelling overland,
        but usually only <b>half as fast</b> in difficult terrain like dense forests or steep mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
        This travel pace assumes your group is travelling at a leisurely pace while not doing much more than talking and
        looking around.
    </p>

    <h2>Forced March</h2>
    <p>
        When travelling more than 2 watches in a day, you get 1 level of exhaustion for each additional watch travelled.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you haven’t travelled the full watch, you might avoid getting exhausted.
        To resist exhaustion, you need to make as many strength saves as extra hours travelled and succeed on every
        single one.
    </p>

    <h2>Fast Pace</h2>
    <p>
        You can choose to travel faster, at 4 miles per hour, but each hour counts as two when considering exhaustion.
    </p>

    <h2>Mounts</h2>
    <p>
        Horses allow you to travel at a fast pace for a short period of time (one watch)
        or at a normal pace for a longer period of time, an extra watch, before the animal starts getting exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Horses are more often used for their capacity of carrying weight than speed.
    </p>

    <h2>Light</h2>
    <p>
        There are four general levels of light:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Darkness.</b> Inside a dark dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Dim.</b> Darker nights, a dark dungeon with a lamp or torch.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Bright.</b> Brighter nights, a dark night with a lamp or torch.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Daylight.</b> An average fall or spring day outside.
    </p>
    <p>
        These depend on your location, the time of day and whether or not you have a source of light, which usually
        improves the light level by one (up to Bright).
    </p>

    <h2>Searching</h2>
    <p>
        Finding things largely depends on two things: <b>light</b> and <b>time</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hidden things have a <b>level of concealment</b>: the light level in which you can find it if you search for it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your light level is above its level of concealment, you can spot it right away without searching.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your light level is below, you can’t find it by searching.
    </p>
    <p>
        How long you need to spend searching depends on the area.
        In general it takes <b>one turn</b> to explore a dungeon room and <b>one watch</b> to explore a wilderness area.
    </p>

    <h2>Hiding</h2>
    <p>
        The rules for searching also apply to things searching for you.
        Your level of concealment depends on your location, light level, and, if you’re moving, your speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        When moving, a fast pace lowers your level of concealment by one, while moving at half speed, increases it by
        one.
    </p>

    <h2>Danger</h2>
    <p>
        Time spent away from the safety of settlements is dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every <b>watch</b> spent in the <b>wilderness</b>, and every <b>turn</b> spent in a <b>dungeon</b>, there's a <b>1-in-6</b> change of encountering some form of danger.
    </p>


    <div style="display: none;">

        <h2>Foraging</h2>
        <p>
            How much you can get and how long it takes
            Cooking supplies turn foraging into things
        </p>

        <h2>Camping</h2>
        <p>
            Shelter otherwise exhaustion due to sleep deprivation
        </p>

        <h2>Armor Class (AC)</h2>
        <p>
            The armor you wear determines your AC and adds to your hit points. The base AC for unarmoured characters is
            10.
        </p>
        <h2>Shields</h2>
        <p>
            A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Requires one hand to wield. While focusing
            solely on defending, the wielder can impose disadvantage on any front facing attacks. While supported by a
            shieldwall formation, the AC bonus is doubled against front facing attacks.
        </p>

        <h2>Gambeson</h2>
        <p>
            A padded armor that consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting
        </p>

        <h2>Mail</h2>
        <p>
            Armour made of interlocking metal rings. Should be worn on top of a gambeson to prevent chafing and to
            cushion
            the impact of blows. Imposes disadvantages to swimming.
        </p>

        <h2>Donning Time</h2>
        <p>
            It takes 1 minute to don or doff mail or gambeson. It takes 2 minutes to don or donoff both. Being assisted
            halves the time it takes to don or donoff.

        <h2>Melee</h2>
        <p>
            Melee attacks against targets without a melee weapon or equivalent to threaten the attacker have advantage.
            This
            applies most commonly against targets with ranged weapons such as bows or slings.
        </p>

        <h2>Range</h2>
        <p>
            A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown
            property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second
            indicates
            the weapon's long range
        </p>
        <p>
            When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a
            target
            beyond the weapon's long range.
        </p>

        <h2>Thrown</h2>
        <p>
            If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. You can attempt to
            throw
            items (such as a bottle of acid) up to 20th by making a ranged attack roll against the target.
        </p>

        <h2>Damage Rolls</h2>
        <p>
            You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Unarmed strikes
            deal 1
            + your Strength modifier in damage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some other items that are not weapons also have damage rolls, as listed in the item’s description.
        </p>

        <h2>Finesse</h2>
        <p>
            Allows you to exploit a foe's distraction or weak spot, dealing extra 2d6 damage to one creature you hit
            with an
            attack if you have advantage on the attack roll.
        </p>

        <h2>Versatile</h2>
        <p>
            This weapon can be used with one or two hands, dealing more damage when using two hands (two handed damage
            in
            parenthesis).
        </p>

        <h2>Long</h2>
        <p>
            Offers double the melee range of other weapons and can melee attack from behind shieldwall formations.
            However,
            due to its size, it can’t be easily carried without one hand and, while carried this way, imposes
            disadvantage
            on ability checks that rely on both hands like swimming and climbing.
        </p>

        <h2>Free Hand</h2>
        <p>
            When using a melee weapon in only one hand while having no weapon or shield in the other hand, you can use
            your
            Dexterity, instead of your Strength modifier, for the attack roll.
        </p>

        <h2>Two-Handed</h2>
        <p>
            This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.
        </p>

        <h2>Improvised Weapons</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An object that
            can be
            used to hurt but bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage
