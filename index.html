    </h1>

    <h2>Ability Scores</h2>
    <p>
        PCs have three abilities: <b>Strength (STR)</b>, <b>Dexterity (DEX)</b>, and <b>Intelligence (INT)</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Saves</h2>
    <p>
        If a character attempts something where the outcome is uncertain and failure has consequences, they need to make
        a save.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make a save, <b>roll a d20 and add the most relevant ability's score</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the <b>total is at least 10</b>, the character succeeds. If not, they fail.
    </p>

    <h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
    <p>
        If there are factors or abilities that make the save significantly easier or harder, the roll has either
        advantage or disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a roll has advantage, roll 2d20 and use the better of the two dice.
    </p>
    <p>
        If it has disadvantage, roll 2d20 and use the worse of the two dice.
    </p>

    </h1>

    <h2>Stress</h2>
    <p>
        Once per save, you may re-roll d20 and take 1 stress.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every 1 stress above your intelligence, you get -1 to all saves.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every full day of rest in safety, halve and round down your stress.
    </p>

    <h2>Hit Points</h2>
    <p>
        Hit points protect you from lethal damage. Subtract hit points when you take damage.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don’t have enough hit points, subtract the leftover damage from your strength. You die on 0 or less
        strength.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every full day of rest in safety, double your hit points (minimum of 1).
    </p>
    <p>
        For every full week of rest in safety, recover 1 strength.
    </p>

    <h2>Exhaustion</h2>
    <p>
        Characters get 1 level of exhaustion:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>-</b> For each consecutive day without enough sleep (8 hours)
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>-</b> For each consecutive day without enough clean water
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>-</b> For each day without enough food
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>-</b> For a week of travel without a full day of rest
    </p>

    <br />

    <table style="margin: 0">
        <thead>
            <tr>

                <td style="text-align: left;">Travels at half speed</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td style="text-align: center;">5</td>
                <td style="text-align: left;">Can’t travel. Can only crawl or walk with assistance.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td style="text-align: center;">6</td>
                <td style="text-align: left;">Death</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        Other conditions like encumberance and forced marches also cause exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each full day of rest in safety with enough food, water and sleep, recover 1 level of exhaustion
    </p>

    <h2>Inventory</h2>
    <p>
        PCs can carry up to 5 stones (abbreviated as "st.") without being encumbered.
        A backpack doubles this limit to 10.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can think of your inventory as having 10 slots where some items take more than 1 slot and others can be group together into the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most items take up 1 stone worth of capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heavy or bulky items take 2 or more stones.
    </p>
    <p>
        Very light ones take 1/4 stones (you can fit 4 of these in the same "slot").
    </p>
    <p>
        Items that take less than 1/4 stones of capacity can be all grouped into the same slot (within reason).
    </p>
    <p>
        100 coins are roughly 1 stone of capacity.
    </p>

        Adventuring
        <hr />
    </h1>

    <h2>Time</h2>
    <p>
        One <b>round</b> is <b>10 seconds</b>. This is usually the unit of time-tracking during combat.
    </p>
    <p>
        One <b>minute</b> is <b>6 rounds</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One <b>turn</b> is <b>10 minutes</b>. This is usually the unit of time-tracking when dungeon delving.
    </p>
    <p>
        One <b>hour</b> is <b>6 turns</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One <b>watch</b> is <b>4 hours</b>. This is usually the unit of time-tracking when travelling overland.
    </p>
    <p>
        One <b>day</b> is divided into <b>6 watches</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Travel Pace</h2>
    <p>
        In ideal conditions, you can cover <b>3 miles per hour</b> while travelling overland,
        but usually only <b>half as fast</b> in difficult terrain like dense forests or steep mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
        This travel pace assumes your group is travelling at a leisurely pace while not doing much more than talking and
        looking around.
    </p>

    <h2>Forced March</h2>
    <p>
        When travelling more than 2 watches in a day, you get 1 level of exhaustion for each additional watch travelled.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you haven’t travelled the full watch, you might avoid getting exhausted.
        To resist exhaustion, you need to make as many strength saves as extra hours travelled and succeed on every
        single one.
    </p>

    <h2>Fast Pace</h2>
    <p>
        You can choose to travel faster, at 4 miles per hour, but each hour counts as two when considering exhaustion.
    </p>

    <h2>Encumbrance</h2>
    <p>
        Carrying more than your capacity makes you encumbered and gives you disadvantage on all dexterity saves.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every watch of travel while encumbered, you get one level of exhaustion.
        You can stave off the exhaustion by succeeding on as many strength saves as stones over your capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can't carry more than twice your capacity any significant distance without getting exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can't carry more than thrice your capacity at all.
    </p>

    <h2>Riding</h2>
    <p>
        Horses allow you to travel at a fast pace for a short period of time (one watch)
        or at a normal pace for a longer period of time, an extra watch, before the animal starts getting exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Horses are more often used for their capacity than for their speed.
    </p>

    <h2>Light</h2>
    <p>
        There are four general levels of light:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Darkness.</b> Inside a dark dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Dim.</b> Darker nights, a dark dungeon with a lamp or torch.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Bright.</b> Brighter nights, a dark night with a lamp or torch.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Daylight.</b> An average fall or spring day outside.
    </p>
    <p>
        These depend on your location, the time of day and whether or not you have a source of light, which usually
        improves the light level by one (up to Bright).
    </p>

    <h2>Searching</h2>
    <p>
        Finding things largely depends on two things: <b>light</b> and <b>time</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hidden things have a <b>level of concealment</b>: the minimum light level you need to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your light level is <b>equal or above</b> its level of concealment, you will <b>find it on a search</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your light level is below its level of concealment, you can’t find it by searching.
    </p>
    <p>
        How long you need to spend searching depends on the area.
        In general it takes <b>one turn</b> to explore a dungeon room and <b>one watch</b> to explore a wilderness area.
    </p>

    <h2>Hiding</h2>
    <p>
        The rules for searching also apply to things searching for you.
        Your level of concealment depends on your location, light level, and, if you’re moving, your speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        When moving, a fast pace lowers your level of concealment by 1, while moving at half speed, increases it by 1.
    </p>

    <h2>Foraging</h2>
    <p>
        There are 3 different ways to forage for food. Each one takes <b>1 watch</b>, requires a different <b>tool</b> and a <b>special location</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each 1 stone worth of rations feeds 1 adult for 1 day.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Gathering</b> Requires a bag and dense foliage. Get 1d6 "green rations" (fruits, vegetables). Spoils in 1d6 days.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Hunting.</b> Requires a trap or a ranged weapon and a game region. Get 1d6 "red rations" (meat). Spoils in 1d6 watches.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Fishing.</b> Requires a fishing set and fishing spot. Get 1d6 "blue rations" (fish). Spoils in 2d6 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        Uncooked rations have a 1-in-6 chance of causing disease.
    </p>

    <h2>Camping</h2>
    <p>
        Setting up camp takes 1 watch, it provides shelter and a cooking site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lack of proper shelter will always cause 1 point of exhaustion for lack of proper sleep and has a 1-in-6 chance of causing a disease in the right conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Diseases</h2>
    <p>
        Usually caused by lack of proper shelter or contracted from eating raw rations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Roll 2d6 for the severity. The GM rolls secretly for the actual disease.
    </p>
    <p><b>-</b> 4 or less: Deadly. Needs treatment.</p>
    <p><b>-</b> 5 to 9: Rough. Will pass in less than a week.</p>
    <p><b>-</b> 10 or more: Mild: Lasts for a most a couple of days</p>

    <h2>Stashes</h2>
    <p>
        Stashes are well hidden locations that you can easily find again to store items without fear of losing them.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Finding a stash.</b> Requires knowing about it from some source of information, like a map or a person.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Creating a stash.</b> Requires searching the area for a suitable location.
    </p>

    <h2>Encounters</h2>
    <p>
        Every <b>watch</b> spent in the <b>wilderness</b>, and every <b>turn</b> spent in a <b>dungeon</b>,
        there's a <b>1-in-6</b> chance of an encountering of some kind
    </p>
    <p>
        In the wilds, an encounter has a given likelyhood of being danger, neutral, or even friendly, with the location determining the odds of each one.
    </p>
    <p>
        In dungeons, an encounter almost aways means danger, the most common of which are wandering monsters.
        The frequency of these encounters may vary per dungeon, from once a turn to once an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some dungeons, a <b>higher light level</b> means <b>more encounters</b>, but the <b>opposite is sometimes also true</b>.
    </p>

    <h1>
        <hr />
        Combat
        <hr />
    </h1>

    <h2>No Fairness</h2>
    <p>
        You will frequently find yourself in fights you have no chance of winning.
        For that reason, you are advised to stack the odds in your favor as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Combat never awards experience and it's rarely rewarded with loot.
        It should be avoided if possible, or else engaged with extreme caution.
    </p>

    <h2>Retrating</h2>
    <p>
        Combat doesn’t need to last until either side is dead. NPCs and monsters will break their morale and flee.
        Players are encouraged to do likewise.
    </p>

    <h2>Combat Round</h2>
    <p>
        Each round of combat, everyone in the fight takes a turn.
        Everyone on the same side takes theirs takes turns at the same time, in whatever sequence they want.
    </p>
    <p>
        Which side of the conflict takes their turns first is determined by initiative.
    </p>

    <h2>Initiative</h2>
    <p>
        Player characters with initiative get to take a turn before the enemies’ first turns.
    </p>
    <p>
        To determine initiative, each player character makes a dexterity save against the enemies’ dexterity.
        If they succeed, they have initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
        Player characters without initiative have their first turn after all enemies have had theirs.
    </p>

    <h2>Surprise</h2>
    <p>
        If the PCs surprise the opposing forces, they all get initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the player characters are surprised, none of them can get initiative.
    </p>

    <h2>Actions in Combat</h2>
    <p>
        On your turn, you can move, then take one action.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also trade your move to access any item of your inventory or to move further.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can take any action in combat, as long as it’s reasonable,
        but attacking is a very common default when out of better ideas.
    </p>

    <h2>Attacking</h2>
    <p>
        To attack, make a strength save if attacking with melee weapons, or dexterity if ranged.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the <b>total is equal or higher</b> than the target’s <b>armor class</b>, roll the weapons dice for damage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Otherwise, the attack is blocked, parried, dodged or otherwise ineffective.
    </p>

    <h2>Armor Class</h2>
    <p>
        Armor class is determined by your equiped armor and gauges how hard you are to be hurt by an attack.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your armor class is 10 when not wearing any armor.
    </p>

    <h2>Critical Hit</h2>
    <p>
        When you roll a natural 20 for your attack, the attack hits and it’s a critical hit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Roll twice as many damage dice as the attack normally would.
        The minimum damage for a critical hit is the best damage possible with a normal hit.
    </p>

    <h1>
        <hr />
        Magic
        <hr />
    </h1>

    <h2>Spells</h2>
    <p>
        Essentially alchemy. Magic is manifested and controlled with geometrical shapes and special materials.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are three ways to cast spells: <b>cantrips</b>, <b>rituals</b>, and <b>artifacts</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Cantrips</h2>
    <p>
        Simple, maleable, quick, and weak spells.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can tweak and modify the invocation with an intelligence save,
        but if you fail the save, you <b>take 1d6 stress</b>.
        The more you modify it, the harder the save.
    </p>
    <p>
        To cast a cantrip, you must stand still and use both hands to draw the invocation circles in the air.
        In combat, that means it takes your whole turn (movement + action) to cast a cantrip, without holding any weapons.
    </p>

    <h2>Rituals</h2>
    <p>
        Complex, inflexible, slow, and powerful spells.
    </p>
    <p>
        To cast a ritual, you need at least 1 hour and 1 slot worth of components for that ritual.
        The material components for one invocation usually cost around 10 silver and are consumed when casting.
    </p>
    <p>
        The effect of the ritual lasts until you lose consciousness (usually when you go to sleep).
        You can make making an intelligence save to make it last longer (of difficulty +1 per day).
        If the save fails, the components are lost.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only one ritual effect can be active at the same time.
    </p>

    <div style="display: none;">
        <h2>Artifacts</h2>
        <p>
            Mostly passive, some are active, with spells between cantrips and rituals.
            Anyone can use but there are saves to avoid corruption
        </p>

        <h2>Corruption</h2>
        <p>
            Stress on failure.
            Your control over this source of magic is limited. This is the only save in the game you cannot re-roll at the cost of stress.
        </p>
    </div>

        1. Roll 3d6 for each of their abilities, in order.
        The lowest of the three dice on each roll is that ability’s score.
        After you’ve finished rolling, you can swap the scores of two abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Choose a class. Determine starting hit points, and choose one ability.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. You start with 200 silver. Buy some equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Choose a name for your PC, but don’t get too attached. It’s dangerous out there.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        Every 1 silver worth of loot the party brings back from dangerous locations earns each character in the party 1 experience.

    <p>
        Every time you gain a level, your hit points increase and you get to choose a new ability from your class.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experience needed to reach the next level is always 1000 x your current level
