        How To Play
        <hr />
    </h1>
    <h2>Core Mechanic</h2>
    <p>
        In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game relies on rolls of a
        d20, to determine success or failure. Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three kinds of d20
        rolls and all three work the same way:
    </p>
    <p>
        Roll a d20 and add all bonuses and penalties determined by the GM. Compare the total to a target number. If the
        total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success.
        Otherwise, it's a failure.
    </p>
    <h2>Difficulty Class (DC)</h2>
    <p>
        The target number is called the difficulty class or DC. The DC is a measure of how hard the task is to
        accomplish successfully and it’s determined differently for each type of roll.
    </p>
    <h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by
        special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding
        a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite
    </p>
    <p>
        When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of
        the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
        If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll
        more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one
        additional d20. If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to
        have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and
        only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage or disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
        You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, but the GM can also
        decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose
        disadvantage as a result.
    </p>
    <h2>Round Down</h2>
    <p>
        Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if
        the fraction is one-half or greater.

    <h2>Armor Class (AC)</h2>
    <p>
        The armor you wear determines your AC and adds to your hit points. The base AC for unarmoured characters is 10.
    </p>
    <h2>Shields</h2>
    <p>
        A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Requires one hand to wield. While focusing
        solely on defending, the wielder can impose disadvantage on any front facing attacks. While supported by a
        shieldwall formation, the AC bonus is doubled against front facing attacks.
    </p>

    <h2>Gambeson</h2>
    <p>
        A padded armor that consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting
    </p>

    <h2>Mail</h2>
    <p>
        Armour made of interlocking metal rings. Should be worn on top of a gambeson to prevent chafing and to cushion
        the impact of blows. Imposes disadvantages to swimming.
    </p>

    <h2>Donning Time</h2>
    <p>
        It takes 1 minute to don or doff mail or gambeson. It takes 2 minutes to don or donoff both. Being assisted
        halves the time it takes to don or donoff.

    <h2>Melee</h2>
    <p>
        Melee attacks against targets without a melee weapon or equivalent to threaten the attacker have advantage. This
        applies most commonly against targets with ranged weapons such as bows or slings.
    </p>

    <h2>Range</h2>
    <p>
        A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown
        property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates
        the weapon's long range
    </p>
    <p>
        When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target
        beyond the weapon's long range.
    </p>

    <h2>Thrown</h2>
    <p>
        If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. You can attempt to throw
        items (such as a bottle of acid) up to 20th by making a ranged attack roll against the target.
    </p>

    <h2>Damage Rolls</h2>
    <p>
        You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Unarmed strikes deal 1
        + your Strength modifier in damage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some other items that are not weapons also have damage rolls, as listed in the item’s description.
    </p>

    <h2>Finesse</h2>
    <p>
        Allows you to exploit a foe's distraction or weak spot, dealing extra 2d6 damage to one creature you hit with an
        attack if you have advantage on the attack roll.
    </p>

    <h2>Versatile</h2>
    <p>
        This weapon can be used with one or two hands, dealing more damage when using two hands (two handed damage in
        parenthesis).
    </p>

    <h2>Long</h2>
    <p>
        Offers double the melee range of other weapons and can melee attack from behind shieldwall formations. However,
        due to its size, it can’t be easily carried without one hand and, while carried this way, imposes disadvantage
        on ability checks that rely on both hands like swimming and climbing.
    </p>

    <h2>Free Hand</h2>
    <p>
        When using a melee weapon in only one hand while having no weapon or shield in the other hand, you can use your
        Dexterity, instead of your Strength modifier, for the attack roll.
    </p>

    <h2>Two-Handed</h2>
    <p>
        This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.
    </p>

    <h2>Improvised Weapons</h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An object that can be
        used to hurt but bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage
    </p>
